## üìã Project Overview

The **House Price Prediction** dataset provides detailed information about house features and their respective sale prices. The purpose of this project is to:
1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, correlations, and outliers.
2. Prepare the dataset for future predictive modeling.
3. Visualize key relationships and patterns to better understand the data.

This project covers only the **EDA** phase. The insights gained will serve as a baseline for future steps, such as feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## üè† Dataset Description

The dataset is sourced from the [Kaggle House Prices dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). It includes **81 features** describing various attributes of houses, such as their location, size, age, and sale prices.

### Key Columns
- **SalePrice**: The target variable representing the house's sale price.
- **Numerical Features**: Includes continuous features like `LotArea`, `GrLivArea`, and `YearBuilt`.
- **Categorical Features**: Includes discrete features like `Neighborhood`, `MSZoning`, and `BldgType`.

## üîç EDA Highlights

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Inspection**
- Inspected the shape, column data types, and overall structure of the dataset.
- Checked for null values and calculated their proportions for each column.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Missing Values Analysis**
- Identified features with missing values and visualized their distributions.
- Considered strategies for handling missing data, including:
  - Dropping irrelevant columns.
  - Imputing missing values using techniques like median or KNN-based imputation.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Feature Types**
- Classified features into **numerical**, **categorical**, and **time-related**.
- Further divided numerical features into continuous and discrete subsets:
  - **Continuous Features**: Features with a wide range of unique values.
  - **Discrete Features**: Features with fewer unique values (‚â§25).

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Univariate Analysis**
- Visualized the distributions of numerical features using histograms and KDE plots.
- Plotted bar charts for discrete and categorical features to analyze their frequency distributions.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Bivariate Analysis**
- Explored relationships between `SalePrice` and other features:
  - Correlation heatmaps for numerical features.
  - Boxplots and bar plots for categorical features.
- Identified features with high correlations to `SalePrice` (e.g., `GrLivArea`, `OverallQual`).

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Outlier Detection**
- Used boxplots and scatterplots to detect and visualize outliers in key features.
- Considered outlier treatment methods for future modeling.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Feature Relationships**
- Analyzed relationships between numerical features using scatterplots and pairplots.
- Explored temporal trends (e.g., `YearBuilt` vs. `SalePrice`).

## üìä Key Findings

1. **Strong Predictors**:
   - Features like `OverallQual`, `GrLivArea`, and `TotalBsmtSF` have a strong positive correlation with `SalePrice`.

2. **Neighborhood Trends**:
   - Certain neighborhoods consistently show higher median house prices.

3. **Outliers**:
   - Detected potential outliers in features like `GrLivArea` and `LotFrontage`, which may need treatment during modeling.

4. **Missing Values**:
   - Features like `PoolQC`, `MiscFeature`, and `Alley` have significant missing values, suggesting they might be candidates for removal.
